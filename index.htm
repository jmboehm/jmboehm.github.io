                  <p class="small">
                        How much do changes in the fragmentation of production contribute to growth? Using detailed plant-level data on the manufacturing sector in India between 1990 and 2014, we study a version of Smithian growth, the link between greater fragmentation of supply chains and productivity. We propose a measure of a plant's vertical span, which corresponds roughly to the number of stages in a supply chain that the plant performs in-house; when plants have smaller vertical spans, production is more fragmented. We find that fragmentation increases with development in both the cross-section and time series. Further, within locations at a point in time, larger plants tend to have smaller vertical spans, and those that increase sales tend to decrease vertical span. Using changes in demand during the tariff liberalization in the 1990s, we provide evidence that increased demand causes specialization. We find evidence for economies of scale in specialization. We construct a general equilibrium model to rationalize these findings and estimate the sources and magnitude of scale economies. Goods are produced in a succession of steps, each combining labor and a set of intermediate inputs, giving rise to a tree-like structure. Firms exert effort to find suppliers for inputs, and choose the set of production stages (and thereby inputs) to produce the output at lowest cost. The structure implies that the returns to searching are more strongly diminishing for inputs that are further upstream. Firms with high productivity draws are therefore more likely to choose to be more vertically specialized. <i>(Updated 2022-11-03)</i></p>

                        <p class="small">What caused the end of antiquity, the shift of economic activity away from the Mediterranean towards northern Europe and the Middle East? To answer this question, we assemble a database of hundreds of thousands of ancient coins from the 4th to the 10th century, estimate a dynamic model of trade and money where coins gradually diffuse along trade routes, and recover regional real consumption time series. Our estimates suggest that technical progress, increased minting, and to a lesser degree the fall in trade flows over the newly formed border between Islam and Christianity contributed to the relative growth of Muslim Spain and the Frankish lands of northern Europe and the decline of the Roman-Byzantine world. Our estimates are consistent with the increased urbanization of western and northern Europe relative to the eastern Mediterranean from the 8th to the 10th century. <i>(Updated 2024-11-19)</i></p>

                        <p class="small">This paper considers how far private adaptation may reduce future vulnerability to climate risks. Using data on monthly firm-to-firm transactions from Pakistan, we find that flood-affected firms are more likely to relocate to safer ground, and shift purchases towards suppliers in less flood-prone regions and reached via less flood-prone roads. The results indicate that firms are imperfectly informed about flood risk, and update their beliefs following floods. We quantify aggregate impacts using a spatial model of endogenous production network formation. The findings suggest that climate change impacts will be mediated as firms learn from the experience of increasingly frequent disasters. <i>(Updated 2024-07-18)</i></p>

                        <p class="small">(with Ezra Oberfield, Ruairidh South, and Mazhar Waseem)</p>

                        <p class="small">We study theoretically and empirically how firm-to-firm sales relationships shape firm dynamics and productivity. We first present a parsimonious model of firm dynamics where dynamics arise from the arrival of new potential matches between firms, acting as supply shocks from the perspective of buyers, and as demand shock from the perspective of suppliers. Buyers switch to new suppliers when it is optimal to do so. The model matches the empirical regularities on firm volatility and exit probabilities declining with size, endogenous fat tails in firm growth rates, and some firms with persistently (but not permanently) high growth rates. We apply the model to a setting in which contracting frictions between firms give rise to long-term relationships. These arrangements improve incentives within the relationship, but firms switch to new suppliers less frequently. This reduces firm dynamism, in the sense that firm sales are less volatile, there is less mean reversion, exit rates are lower, and the right tail of the firm size distribution is thinner. We corroborate these predictions with production data on Indian manufacturing plants and transaction-level data from Pakistan, using variation across regions in court congestion as a proxy for weak formal enforcement and variation across industries in whether the output requires customization. Using a quantitative implementation of our model we show that the dynamic cost of long-term contracts is significant, with the increased court congestion between the state with the fastest courts and the state with the slowest courts reducing aggregate productivity by roughly 15%. <i>(Updated 2024-09-13)</i></p>

                       Resource-based theories propose that firms grow by diversifying into products that use common capabilities. We provide evidence for common input capabilities, using a policy that removed entry barriers in input markets to show that the similarity of a firm's and an industry's input mix determines firm production choices. We model industry choice and economies of scope from input capabilities. When the model is estimated for Indian manufacturing, input complementarities make firms 5% more likely to produce in an industry and are quantitatively as important as time-invariant drivers of coproduction rates. Upstream entry barriers were equivalent to a 9.5% tariff on inputs.</p>

                  <p class="small">This paper studies the prevalence of potential anticompetitive effects of vertical mergers using a novel data set on U.S. and international buyer-seller relationships and across a large range of industries. We find that relationships are more likely to break when suppliers vertically integrate with one of the buyers' competitors than when they vertically integrate with an unrelated firm. This relationship holds for both domestic and cross-border mergers and for domestic and international relationships. It also holds when instrumenting mergers using exogenous downward pressure on the supplier's stock prices, suggesting that reverse causality is unlikely to explain the result. In contrast, the relationship vanishes when using rumored or announced but not completed integration events. Firms experience a substantial drop in sales when one of their suppliers integrates with one of their competitors. This sales drop is mitigated if the firm has alternative suppliers in place. These findings are consistent with anticompetitive effects of vertical mergers, such as vertical foreclosure, rising input costs for rivals, or self-foreclosure.</p>

                  <p class="small"><i>Quarterly Journal of Economics</i> 135(4), p. 2007-2058, November 2020</p>

                  <p class="small">The strength of contract enforcement determines how firms source inputs and organize production. Using microdata on Indian manufacturing plants, we show that production and sourcing decisions appear systematically distorted in states with weaker enforcement. Specifically, we document that in industries that tend to rely more heavily on relationship-specific intermediate inputs, plants in states with more congested courts shift their expenditures away from intermediate inputs and appear to be more vertically integrated. To quantify the impact of these distortions on aggregate productivity, we construct a model in which plants have several ways of producing, each with different bundles of inputs. Weak enforcement exacerbates a holdup problem that arises when using inputs that require customization, distorting both the intensive and extensive margins of input use. The equilibrium organization of production and the network structure of input-output linkages arise endogenously from the producers' simultaneous cost minimization decisions. We identify the structural parameters that govern enforcement frictions from cross-state variation in the first moments of producers' cost shares. A set of counterfactuals show that enforcement frictions lower aggregate productivity to an extent that is relevant on the macro scale.</p>

                  <p class="small">I study how supplier contracting frictions shape the patterns of intermediate input use and quantify the impact of these distortions on aggregate productivity. Using the frequency of litigation between US firms as a novel measure to capture the need for formal enforcement, I find a robust relationship between countries' input-output structure and their quality of legal institutions. In countries with high enforcement costs, firms have lower expenditure shares on intermediate inputs in sector pairs where US firms litigate frequently for breach of contract. A quantitative model shows that improvement of contract enforcement institutions would lead to sizable welfare gains.</p>
